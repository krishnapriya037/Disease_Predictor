# Disease Predictor 🩺  

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System**.  
It takes patient input data (such as symptoms, test results, or health indicators) and predicts the likelihood of a particular disease.  

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation  
- Prediction based on user input  
- Jupyter/Colab notebook support  

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Diseasepredictor.ipynb` → Main Colab notebook with code and model  
- `data/` → Dataset used for training and testing (if applicable)  
- `README.md` → Project documentation  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
